My final year project at Loughborough University, 
where I developed a bespoke ML model to predict UFC fight outcomes. 
This ML Pipeline covers:
- Verifying the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Pre-processing, including adding Fighter skill ratings with the Bayesian Bradley-Terry Model
- Building an ensemble model with Dynamic Clustering, KNN and RandomForest for accurate predictions.
